This is my cheat-sheet of project names versus what they actually are. Note there's a ton of opinion here. 

- apache - the old-school webserver. still very popular.
- bundler - ruby gem dependency manager. 
- docker - linux containers made easy. https://www.docker.com/
- eureka - Netflix Middle-tier load balancing, jvm, use eureka client.
- gitolite - ssh-based git repository manager, support for "wild" repos. Tom's current favorite.
- gitorious - git repo with gui. had issues installing it. 
- gitlab - git repo with gui (fox head). Not bad, frequent updates make for stability issues.
- github - ye olde github. Awesome, open source only. Enterprise is pricey. 
- go - google's language for systems. better than C. very popular. Still kinda low level. nice multitasking support.
- gollum - git-based markdown wiki - you're soaking in it. https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki
- haproxy - http/https load balancer http://www.haproxy.org/
- hashie - ruby gem enhances hashes
- logstash - log parsing/aggregating. uses json. jvm. this plus elasticsearch and such == free splunk
- loopback - node-based RESTful API prototype and server. part of strongloop stuff.
- luvit - lua-based non-blocking nodeish thing. https://github.com/luvit/luvit 
- machine - docker host provisioning
- markdown - text-based annotation - http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
- nginx - load balancer http://nginx.org/
- node - java-based non-blocking http://nodejs.org/ see also luvit
- npm - node package manager
- python - scripting language for people who think they're smart. fundamentally flawed, but useful. see also ruby
- rbenv - ruby environment switcher/builder
- redis - key/value data structure in-memory server. nutty fast. Tom's favorite. 
- repose - REST front-end proxy to handle auth, logging, rate-limiting. 
- ruby - scripting language, Tom's favorite. package manager is named 'gem'
- splunk - log aggregator and searching. very nice. very costly.
- swarm - docker clustering
- tower - OS X git client, many features, paid. http://www.git-tower.com/
- tower - ansible management, paid.
- zuul - nettflix edge routing. aws-specific.
